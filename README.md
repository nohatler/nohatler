## Unity 3D Developer

### About Me
I'm Max and I live in Ukraine, I develop games on Unity. Most of all I love creating atmospheric horror themes games. 
I'm full of energy, ideas and a desire to create. Always ready to get down to work! (ﾉ´ ᵕ `)ノ 

I have experience working in a fairly large studio [SMOKOKO LTD](https://smokoko.com), 
accepting project orders from private individuals, and personal game 
development for [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6435753158768558988&hl=uk).
